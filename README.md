# INF552: Data Visualization

This project was completed as part of the "Data Visualization" course taught by Emmanuel Pietriga at École Polytechnique.

## Project Description

The objective of this project was to visualize data related to the metro and RER stations in the Paris transportation network. We used comprehensive datasets to create interesting visualizations, particularly with geographic data. Our visualizations not only display the metro stations and lines but also provide practical information, such as the availability of defibrillators and restrooms at each station.

Our project was entirely coded in **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, and the data files used were in **.csv** and **.geojson** formats.

## Features

- **Interactive navigation**: Allows users to navigate between different metro and RER stations.
- **Statistics**: Displays statistics for each station as well as for Paris districts.
- **Geographical visualization**: Uses geographical data to represent the Paris transportation network on a map.
- **Practical information**: Indicates the availability of defibrillators and restrooms at each station.
- **Animations and intuitive design**: User-friendly interface with a convenient navigation bar and smooth animations.

## Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoutetMaxime/DataVisRATP.git
   cd DataVisRATP
   ```
2. Open index.html in your browser to explore the web application.

## Usage

- Use the navigation bar to select stations and display associated statistics.
- Explore the different layers of visualizations (stations, metro lines, district statistics).
- Activate filters to view stations equipped with defibrillators or restrooms.

## Datasets Used
- **CSV**: Contains information about the stations (name, line, available services, etc.).
- **GeoJSON**: Represents the geolocation of metro and RER stations and lines.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**
- **HTML / CSS**
- **D3.js** for data visualization
- **Leaflet.js** for the interactive map
- **CSV** and **GeoJSON** for datasets
